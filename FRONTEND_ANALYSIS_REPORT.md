**Overall Summary:**
*   The repository contains a frontend-only application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that uses `localStorage` for data persistence and simulates e-commerce functionalities.
*   Recent refactoring has introduced `fetch` calls to some documented API endpoints (e.g., for checkout, order tracking), but these currently point to non-existent backend services.
*   The admin-side functionalities described in `1_REQUIRMENTS.txt` are entirely unimplemented.
*   Key user-side features are present and have seen recent improvements in data display and form completeness.

**Page-by-Page Analysis:**

*   **`index.html` (Landing Page):**
    *   **Met:** Serves as a functional landing page, provides navigation to product categories and business information.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:** Does not directly list products as per "Product Listing" requirement (defers to `products.html`).

*   **`products.html` (Product Listing Page):**
    *   **Met:** Basic structure for product display (grid, card template, category tabs) is present.
    *   **Partially Met/Improvements:** Products are now dynamically loaded from `data/mock-products.json`.
        *   Product card now displays 'stock quantity'.
        *   Category filtering is functional using the mock data categories.
        *   `addToCart` functionality is implemented and correctly uses `js/storage.js`.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   Product data is from a local mock JSON, not a live API endpoint (`/api/products`).

*   **`cart.html` (Shopping Cart Page):**
    *   **Met:** Fully meets "Shopping Cart" requirements.
        *   Cart logic is entirely in JavaScript using `localStorage`.
        *   Displays item details, allows quantity updates, removal.
        *   Correctly calculates and displays 12% VAT.
        *   Supports data structure for checkout payload.

*   **`checkout.html` (Checkout Page):**
    *   **Met:** Aligns with most "Checkout" and "Payment" requirements.
        *   Collects name, address, phone, and email for shipping.
        *   The 'Email' input field has been added, validated, and integrated into the form submission and (mock) API payload.
        *   Handles 12% VAT.
        *   Simulates order saving (via `localStorage` after attempted `POST /api/checkout`).
        *   Indicates "Cash on Delivery" as the sole payment method.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   (No outstanding discrepancies based on recent updates for this page's structure and forms).

*   **`success.html` (Order Confirmation Page):**
    *   **Met:** Provides basic order confirmation. Displays Order Code and Total with VAT.
        *   Now displays an itemized list of products.
        *   Now displays customer's shipping information (name, address, phone, email).
        *   The message 'Please save this code to track your order.' has been added.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   Order data is still sourced from `localStorage`; API call for this page (`GET /api/orders/{orderCode}`) is not yet implemented.

*   **`track.html` (Order Tracking Page):**
    *   **Met:** Displays Order Date, Shipping Info, and Order Status (after attempted `GET /api/orders/{orderCode}` call).
        *   Now displays an itemized list of products.
    *   **Notes:**
        *   Data is sourced from a (mock) `GET /api/orders/{orderCode}` call; actual API integration is pending.

*   **Admin Pages & Functionality (Conceptual):**
    *   **Not Met:** All admin requirements (Authentication, Product Management, Order Management, Admin Account Management) are entirely unimplemented in this frontend codebase. No admin-facing pages or logic exist.

**Key Overall Discrepancies vs. `1_REQUIRMENTS.txt`:**
*   **Backend Absence:** The most fundamental discrepancy is the lack of the prescribed Java Spring Boot backend. The frontend simulates or attempts to mock interactions that would normally go to this backend.
*   **Dynamic Data:** Product loading is implemented using a local mock JSON file. Integration with a live `/api/products` endpoint is still pending.
*   **Completeness of Information:** Pages like order confirmation and tracking now display detailed itemized lists and shipping information. (This has been significantly improved).
*   **Missing Fields:** The Email field in checkout has been added. (This is resolved).
*   **Admin Section:** Entirely absent.
