**Overall Summary:**
*   The repository contains a frontend-only application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that uses `localStorage` for data persistence and simulates e-commerce functionalities.
*   Recent refactoring has introduced `fetch` calls to some documented API endpoints (e.g., for checkout, order tracking), but these currently point to non-existent backend services.
*   The admin-side functionalities described in `1_REQUIRMENTS.txt` are entirely unimplemented.
*   Key user-side features are present in basic form, but some details and dynamic data aspects are missing.

**Page-by-Page Analysis:**

*   **`index.html` (Landing Page):**
    *   **Met:** Serves as a functional landing page, provides navigation to product categories and business information.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:** Does not directly list products as per "Product Listing" requirement (defers to `products.html`).

*   **`products.html` (Product Listing Page):**
    *   **Met:** Basic structure for product display (grid, card template, category tabs) is present.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   Fails core "Product Listing": No products are dynamically loaded or displayed; defaults to "empty state."
        *   Product card template does not show "stock quantity."
        *   Category filtering is not implemented.
        *   `addToCart` function in `js/products.js` is a non-functional placeholder and does not correctly use the `localStorage` cart.

*   **`cart.html` (Shopping Cart Page):**
    *   **Met:** Fully meets "Shopping Cart" requirements.
        *   Cart logic is entirely in JavaScript using `localStorage`.
        *   Displays item details, allows quantity updates, removal.
        *   Correctly calculates and displays 12% VAT.
        *   Supports data structure for checkout payload.

*   **`checkout.html` (Checkout Page):**
    *   **Met:** Aligns with most "Checkout" and "Payment" requirements.
        *   Collects name, address for shipping.
        *   Handles 12% VAT.
        *   Simulates order saving (via `localStorage` after attempted `POST /api/checkout`).
        *   Indicates "Cash on Delivery" as the sole payment method.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   **Missing "Email" input field**, which is required by `1_REQUIRMENTS.txt`. (JS uses a placeholder for API call).

*   **`success.html` (Order Confirmation Page):**
    *   **Met:** Provides basic order confirmation. Displays Order Code and Total with VAT.
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   Missing a detailed **list of items ordered** (shows only item count).
        *   Missing customer's **shipping information**.
        *   Does not display the specific message: "Please save this code to track your order."
        *   Currently uses `localStorage` to fetch order details (API call refactor for this page was planned but not yet executed).

*   **`track.html` (Order Tracking Page):**
    *   **Met:** Displays Order Date, Shipping Info, and Order Status (after attempted `GET /api/orders/{orderCode}` call).
    *   **Not Met/Discrepancies:**
        *   Missing a detailed **list of items ordered** (shows "Total Amount" instead).

*   **Admin Pages & Functionality (Conceptual):**
    *   **Not Met:** All admin requirements (Authentication, Product Management, Order Management, Admin Account Management) are entirely unimplemented in this frontend codebase. No admin-facing pages or logic exist.

**Key Overall Discrepancies vs. `1_REQUIRMENTS.txt`:**
*   **Backend Absence:** The most fundamental discrepancy is the lack of the prescribed Java Spring Boot backend. The frontend simulates or attempts to mock interactions that would normally go to this backend.
*   **Dynamic Data:** True dynamic product loading is missing.
*   **Completeness of Information:** Pages like order confirmation and tracking lack detailed item lists.
*   **Missing Fields:** E.g., Email field in checkout.
*   **Admin Section:** Entirely absent.
